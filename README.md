# Installation
## Node Server
Change directory to **server** and run **npm install**. And then run **node server.js**. The Node server will start listening on port 3000. Node server is set up to accept CORS from **localhost:4200**. 

## Angular App
Change directory to **my-app** under **chat** folder and run **npm install**. You can run the Angular server by **ng serve**. As CORS is set up on the Node server, this will still allow you send data between the Angular chat app and the node server.

## The README.md files of Node Server and Augular APP are under the **chat** file folder and **server** file folder.
